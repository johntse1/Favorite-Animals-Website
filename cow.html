    <div id="cowdiv">Cattle, taurine cattle, or European cattle are large domesticated cloven-hooved herbivores. They are a prominent modern member of the subfamily Bovinae, are the most widespread species of the genus Bos. Depending on sex, they are referred to as cows or bulls. Cows like to be alone, they like to have friends. So if you have a farm, remember to create a cute Instagram account for your cows so they will be in a better mooooo-d.</div>
