    <div id="axolotldiv">Axolotls are long-lived, surviving up to 15 years on a diet of mollusks, worms, insect larvae, crustaceans, and some fish. Accustomed to being a top predator in its habitat, this species has begun to suffer from the introduction of large fish into its lake habitat. Axolotls are aggressive toward one another, they will bite off each others gills, feet and tails. Body parts of the Ambystoma mexicanum will regenerate.</div>
