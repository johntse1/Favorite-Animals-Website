    <div id="dogdiv">The dog or domestic dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf, characterized by an upturning tail. The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. Their sense of smell is at least 40x better than ours. Dogs can sniff at the same time as breathing. Dogs donâ€™t sweat like we do. Dogs have 18 muscles controlling their ears. Dogs are about as intelligent as a two-year-old.</div>
